# fast Isotonic regression for calibration 

This project include an implementation of the isotonic regression implementation described in [Vovk et al.](http://alrw.net/articles/13.pdf), which relies on pre-computing the regression for all possible scores *s* and for both possible class labels (0 and 1). Those precomputed values are then stored in a binary search tree which give back the `p0` and `p1` values (i.e. the multi-probability for both possible labels, `y=0` and `y=1`, of the test-object). For further details we refer to the paper and the algorithms presented in the referenced paper. The implementation was further aided by the python implementation presented in [Paolo Toccaceli VennABERS](https://github.com/ptocca/VennABERS), although that implementation lacks the binary search tree and is using a functional rather than object based programming model, but was used for reference and deriving a test case to compare output from.
